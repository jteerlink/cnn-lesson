# Model Build for SymptomSentinelAI

# Symptom Sentinel Model

This repository supports the **SymptomSentinelAI** application by providing trained models to detect **ear** and **throat infections** from medical images. It serves as a learning platform for medical image classification using deep learning techniques.

## Repository Structure

- `ear_dataset/`: Contains labeled images for ear infection diagnosis.
- `throat_dataset/`: Contains labeled images for throat infection detection.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks covering preprocessing, model training, and evaluation workflows.
- `setup/`: Scripts and configuration files to set up the training and deployment environment.

## Purpose

The primary objective of this project is to build and validate a machine learning model capable of classifying images of the ear and throat into healthy or infected categories. It contributes to the broader mission of integrating AI into healthcare diagnostics, particularly for use in consumer-facing mobile applications.

## Getting Started

To replicate or extend this project:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jteerlink/symptom-sentinel-model.git
